# RNN Music Generation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **music generation using an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** in PyTorch. The model learns to predict the next character in music sequences written in **ABC notation**.

## Features
- **Character-level modeling** of music sequences.
- Uses a **learnable embedding layer** for efficient symbol representation.
- Generates new music by sampling from the trained model.
- Supports batch training with configurable sequence length and hidden units.

## Notebook
`RNN_Music_generation.ipynb` includes:
1. **Data preprocessing**: Combine ABC music files and vectorize characters.
2. **Model definition**: LSTM network with embedding and fully connected layers.
3. **Training loop**: Cross-entropy loss and backpropagation over sequences.
4. **Music generation**: Sampling and sequence generation in ABC format.
5. **Visualization**: Inspect model outputs and generated sequences.
